sorts the paragraphs so that the paragraphs that contain the most number of keywords appear first to the user and the ones with the least appear

function that only has one expression) is used and in lambda the key of the dictionary is passed as "x" in the argument, in the third
argument we passed reverse=True to sort the paragraphs in descending order based on the length of the list/amount of keywords found in the paragraph's
