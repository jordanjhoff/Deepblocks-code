sorts the tables so that the tables that contain the most number of keywords appear first to the user and the ones with the least appear
last. Sorts the list of tables using the sorted() method: the keys and values of the dictionary are inputted for the first argument,
being the sequence/list that will be looped through, in the second argument which decides how they will be ordered, lambda (an anonymous function/a small 
function that only has one expression) is used and in lambda the key of the dictionary is passed as "x" in the argument, in the third
argument we passed reverse=True to sort the tables in descending order based on the length of the list/amount of keywords found in the table's
